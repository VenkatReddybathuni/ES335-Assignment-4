### Question 1: Binary Classification Task

In this question, you have to compare the performance on a binary classification task of the following models:

- VGG (1 block)
- VGG (3 blocks)
- VGG (3 blocks) with data augmentation
- Transfer learning using VGG16 or VGG19 with tuning all layers (including tuning convolution layers)
- Transfer learning using VGG16 or VGG19 with tuning only final MLP layers (excluding convolution layers)

[Refer this article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-convolutional-neural-network-to-classify-photos-of-dogs-and-cats/) for guidance. You do not need to write your own code, but you should be able to explain your implementation during the viva.

You need to create the dataset on your own based on your first names of any two members from the group. For instance, if the first name of the team members are: **V**aidehi and **R**aghav, they can choose a dataset of their liking based on any names, place, animal, or thing. As examples:

- Vulture vs. Rat
- Vada Pav vs. Roti

You can refer to [resource 1](https://python.plainenglish.io/how-to-automatically-download-bulk-images-for-your-dataset-using-python-f1efffba7a03) or [resource 2](https://github.com/JorgePoblete/DuckDuckGoImages) or download 100 images of both classes (total 200 images). Of these 100 images of each class, we will use 80 for training and 20 for testing. You get 1 mark for dataset creation.

Create a table with models as rows and the following columns [2.5 marks (0.5 marks for each model)]:

- Training time
- Training loss
- Training accuracy
- Testing accuracy
- Number of model parameters

We will now be using Tensorboard for visualizing network performance. You are suggested to refer to:

- [PyTorch + Tensorboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLqsxWaQdHE)
- [Tensorflow + Tensorboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7KfYXXrOj0)

Use Tensorboard to log the following and present screenshots/images [1 mark]:

Scalars:
- Training loss vs. iterations (and not epochs)
- Training accuracy vs. iterations (and not epochs)
- Testing accuracy vs. iterations (and not epochs)

Images:
- Show all images from the test set and their predictions

Now you have to present various insights. For instance, you should discuss the following [2 marks (0.5 marks for each question)]:

- Are the results as expected? Why or why not?
- Does data augmentation help? Why or why not?
- Does it matter how many epochs you fine-tune the model? Why or why not?
- Are there any particular images that the model is confused about? Why or why not?

Now, create an MLP model with a comparable number of parameters as VGG16 and compare your performance with the other models in the table. You can choose the distribution of the number of neurons and the number of layers. What can you conclude? [0.5 marks]

### Question 2: KNN Variants Comparison

In this question, you will implement and compare the following different KNN variants:

- LSH (1.5 marks)
- KD-tree (1.5 marks)
- Naive version of KNN (0.5 marks)

Vary dataset size $N$ and number of dimensions $D$ to do training and testing time and memory comparison for finding $K$ nearest neighbors (1 mark).

Now, in a 2D randomly generated dataset visually show how many of the $K$ closest neighbors approximately $K$ NN methods miss out due to their approximate nature.

Also, show the partitions in the 2D space (0.5 marks).
